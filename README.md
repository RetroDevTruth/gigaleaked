FYI FOR GITHUB ADMINS: THIS WAS ORIGINALLY LAST UPDATED 4 MONTHS AGO AND SHOULDNT BE FLAGGED SINCE RETRO DEV HAS DONE WORST THINGS

Reason for Reupload: someone flaged the original which doesn't make sense since this hasnt been updated

On November 18th, 2022 around 9:36 AM the childx team (mostly mts that was apart of this) would create this github page to get revenge back at Retro Dev due to how incompent Cristaino100 and his staff team is, if you have met the staff team at Retro dev before you may think they are the best people but in reality they arent once you start viewing the staff general or if you are in the retro Dev Discord server then you think better than wrong.

The raid would start at 9:39 AM EST by pinging everyone with the github and unbanning 2 people which would cause more chaos then when someone pinged the verified role by bot. This is also the largest ORC leak unlike the John Bowling IP Leaks according to this screenshot provived by me https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1014158121222025338/1043998565346836550/unknown.png https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHb_14Y6BkY (Recording of the raid)

Over 172,636 messages would end up getting leaked and this would be the most successful thing Childx has done.

Below We will credit people for what they did for us and every revival (except for retro dev)
